# WordPressLite - A ready made WordPress CMS package
The main objective of creating this project is to create a most minimalistic version of WordPress with flat file database. As WordPress is evolving day by day, I think they are adding up too many things which are not required to run a very simple website. 

##How to use guide
- 1. Download the package
- 2. Upload and extract 
- 3. Run http://yourwebsite.com
- 4. Refresh again to implement

##Package includes
- Latest WordPress package from (wordpress.org)
- Flat file database with SQLite
- phpLiteAdmin (https://bitbucket.org/phpliteadmin/public)
- Comment Blacklist for WordPress (https://github.com/splorp/wordpress-comment-blacklist)
- No need to create and configure database users and passwords
