# WordPressLite - A ready made WordPress CMS package
The main objective of creating this project is to create a ready made WordPress package which just runs by copying and pasting the folder. No any strings attached. This is minimalistic version of WordPress with flat file database. Most of the sites don't need heavy configuration in the first place to start running. Just copy the folder and paste. 

##Why do you need WordPressLite?
WordPressLite is copy, paste and starts running WordPress CMS without any configuration on the database side. I was being sick and tired to configure database in the WordPress CMS everytime to move from localhost to staging and staging to production. The migration is alwasy not smooth. WordPressLite has no database as it is flat file database. So, no database and configuration needed. Happy migration :-)
