[![WordPressLite - Minimal WordPress with SQLite database]]

# WordpressLite
The main objective of creating this project is to create a most minimalistic version of WordPress with flat file database. As WordPress is evolving day by day, I think they are adding up too many things which are not required to run a very simple website. 

##Features
- Latest WordPress package from (wordpress.org)
- Flat file database with SQLite
- phpLiteAdmin (https://bitbucket.org/phpliteadmin/public)
- Comment Blacklist for WordPress (https://github.com/splorp/wordpress-comment-blacklist)
